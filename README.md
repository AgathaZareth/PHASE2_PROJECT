# Linear Regression Modeling of the King County House Sales dataset



## Overview

The regression modeling will yield findings to support relevant recommendations for ways renovations may increase the estimated value of a home. Those findings include:
 - an R squared metric to describe the overall model performance.
 - multicollinearity checks with VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) values 
 - visual modeling to show:
  - distribution of the model residuals 
  - linearity checks to show the relationship between Sale Price and features used
  - a homoscedasticity check of the final model. 
  
Finally, there are three feature-specific effects on Sale Price stated in the Final Recommendations sections 


### Business Problem
